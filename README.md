# Control_module_for_a_robotic_navigation_system
This repository is my control module design for my home robot. The module drive 4 electric motors and two other servos. It contains ESP32, MPU9150, CP2102, and STM32F103 chips. The module is designed for recording Lidar, Gyro, and magnetic data, which are need for position recognition and motion planning.
